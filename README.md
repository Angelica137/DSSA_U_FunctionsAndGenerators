# Functions and generator practice

### **Exercise 1**

Create a generator `fact_gen()` that generates factorials. For a number n, n factorial is denoted by n!, and it is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,

> 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Define `prod(a, b)` which returns the product of numbers a and b. You will also define `fact_gen()` which yields the next factorial number.
